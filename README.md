# Heart Disease Analysis

Our dataset is based on UCI heart Disease Data Set [6] and
we have 303 instances. According to UCI, “This database
contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to
using a subset of 14 of them.”We guess too many features will
bring too much noise so people has done feature extraction and
reduce 76 features to 14 features. To better understand the
meaning of the features, we have the responsibility to explain
some of the attributes of original dataset from UCI as follows:
• age: age in years
• sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
• cp: chest pain type
-- Value 0: typical angina
-- Value 1: atypical angina
-- Value 2: non-anginal pain
-- Value 3: asymptomatic
• trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission
to the hospital)
• chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
• fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
• target: Heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes)
